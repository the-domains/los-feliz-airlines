  The ALTA 8 from Freefly is an octo-rotor configuration UAS for aerial
  cinematography. Designed to work in conjunction with a MoVI gimbal (available
  separately), the ALTA 8 will support payloads up to 20 pounds, making it ideal
  for today's lightweight cinema cameras. The ALTA 8 allows the gimbal can be
  mounted above, as well as below, the aircraft, enabling "sky view" shots.

\*  Our new propeller and installation kits
feature a smoother, even more reliable locking mechanism. This optimization has
drastically reduced the abrasion that is common with propeller installation,
therefore prolonging the propeller's overall service life. 

\*  The new motor's performance has also been
improved, providing a greater sense of control. 

\*  Ready-to-fly aerial system 

\*  Included professional 4K camera and 3-axis
stabilization gimbal (Zenmuse X5) 

\*  Live, wireless HD video transmission via DJI
Lightbridge 

\*  Dedicated remote with flight and camera
controls 

\*  Powerful app to adjust camera settings, edit
videos, and more 

\*  Vision Positioning system for GPS-free or
